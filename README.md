# Machine Learning Course â€“ Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for the Machine Learning course assignments.
Each assignment focuses on implementing fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch, without using high-level libraries.

The projects demonstrate skills in data preprocessing, model building, optimization, and evaluation.

## Assignments Overview

| Assignment | Topics |
|:---|:---|
| Assignment 1 | Data Preprocessing and Bias Trick |
| Assignment 2 | Linear Regression from Scratch |
| Assignment 3 | Regularization Techniques (Ridge, Lasso) |
| Assignment 4 | Logistic Regression and Classification |
| Assignment 5 | Basic Neural Networks |

## How to Run

1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Python files directly:
   ```bash
   python assignment1_preprocessing.py
   ```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib (optional, if plotting is included)

(you can adjust based on specific needs)

## About the Course

The assignments were part of the **Machine Learning** course at Reichman University, taught by Prof. Zohar Yakhini.
The focus was on building a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations and algorithmic implementations.

## Notes

- All code was written independently as part of academic coursework.
- Each solution is organized, documented, and tested on provided datasets.
